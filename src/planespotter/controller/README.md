package: planespotter.controller

The controller package contains the main Controller 
and other controlling utils like the ActionHandler, 
which reacts on User-Interactions and (usually) calls 
the controller to do further action.
The Controller itself connects the model with the view,
gets data from ActionHandler, calls the model to work 
with it and finally shows the data in the view
